This repository backs a simple static webpage that is an informal listing of training resources for new engineers looking to develop the requisite knowledge and skills to understand, manage, and maintain projects involving electric propulsion or adjacent equipment.

Aside from the training resources, it contains a list of Learning Objectives.  These are specific skills and knowledge areas within specific domains (e.g Electrical Theory) that experienced engineers within the field have identified as necessary for new engineers entering the field.

All training resources should be tied to specific skills and knowledge areas from the list of Learning Objectives.

All content is contained in ```index.md```.

If you have experience in the field, please contribute to the list of Learning Objectives if you see any missing.  Likewise, please contribute training resources that 
1. satisfy any learning objective(s), and 
2. that you have personal experience with
