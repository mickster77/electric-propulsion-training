>Presented in this tutorial are details about the basics of bolted joint technology and in particular on the mechanics of the load transfer mechanism involved in such joints.  
<cite>-BoltScience</cite>

This tutorial gives all the basics on fasteners, the physics of a bolted joint, and the importance of preload.  Elsewhere on the site there is a lot of great information on the merits of various locking mechanisms, with test data.  This resources is an easy power-up:  Spend an hour or so reading everything, and making sure the math is understood, and suddenly you have much better understanding of what matters with fasteners than the average electrical engineer.  The material will be much more understandable if you have some exposure to strength of materials concepts (e.g. stress/strain).  While you're on a fastener kick, take a look at this [short Fastenal publication](https://www.fastenal.com/content/feds/pdf/Article%20-%20Screw%20Threads%20Design.pdf) on threads.  An important take-away is the distribution of load across engaged threads.  This can be come important when evaluating violations of length-of-engagement requirements.

**Objectives:**

### [SEEING CIRCLES, SINES, AND SIGNALS](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/)
>If you’re really serious about learning the theory and practice of digital signal processing, you should not use this website as your sole resource. Wherever a compromise was necessary, I’ve erred in favor of simplicity over completeness, fun and engagement over rigor. This text is a piece of pop-science and you should treat it as such.  
<cite>-Schaedler</cite>

In spite of the author's disclaimer, this web-based explainer is a great introduction to several important subjects relevant to electrical propulsion equipment: Fourier Transform, Sampling Theory, Nyquist's Theorem, Aliasing, and more.  These concepts regularly come up in the control of electric propulsion systems and in the instrumentation and characterization of electric propulsion systems.  Also, he quotes David Foster Wallace.

<cite>-ChatGPT</cite>

This is about as dry as it gets, but is the best source we've vetted.  Going forward we'll investigate the Defense Acquisition Univerity course catelog and review [this policy document linked by DFARS](https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/USA001270-16-DPAP.pdf) for future replacement of the FAR website as a resource.

This certificate program provides a solid basis for understanding electric propulsion systems.  At a minimum candidates should possess solid familiarity with Maxwell's equations prior to pursuing this program to maximize value.  The pace is pretty slow allowing good uptake, and the time demand is low.  Alternatively, these courses are available as part of the NPS/BRES MSES EE track.

**Objectives:**
DQ0 Transforms, Equivalent Circuit Models, Power Conversion, Motor Theory/Design, PID Control


### [MIT - Design of Electric Motors, Generators, and Drive Systems](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/design-electric-motors-generators-and-drive-systems)

Participants will gain extensive hands-on experience by participating in computer-based laboratory exercises in a MATLAB-compatible, open-source scientific analysis tool called Octave. Participants will also engage in a hardware build session using an Infineon “Programmable System on Chip” (PSoC) 5LP to control a machine in our instructional laboratories.  
<cite>-MIT</cite>

 
This is a very fast paced course.  It is a good follow to the NPS certificate program or previous training on or experience with motor, drive, and control theory.  At a minimum candidates should possess solid familiarity with Maxwell's equations and the DQO transform prior to taking this course to maximize value.

Based on discussions with the lead professor, in recent years they have worked to make the remote option as close as possible to the in person option.  For the physical lab work they provide the equipment via mail to the attendee and labs are worked remotely and in person together in realtime.  Given this, this course should be offered to qualifying engineers liberally.

>This course provides an introduction to the principles and methods of computational structural dynamics and vibration analysis. Modern computational methods make use of the matrix structural models provided by finite element analysis. Therefore, this course provides an introduction to dynamic analysis using the finite element method, and introduces concepts and methods in the calculation of modal parameters, dynamic response via mode superposition, frequency response, model reduction, and structural synthesis techniques. Experimental modal identification techniques will be introduced.  
<cite>-NPS</cite>

This course is offered as an option as part of the NPS/BRES MSES ME track.  Whether it can be included as part of the MSES EE track or as a stand-along course is TBD.  In any case, it provides extremely valuable knowledge and skills for anyone that works with large scale rotating electrical machinery.  It provides a solid introduction of the Lagrangian formulation of kinematics and modal analysis, skills often lacking among electrical engineers.

Learners will be exposed to state-of-the-art methodologies and to considering the challenges of various types of projects.  
<cite>-Coursera</cite>

 
This course probably won't teach much to a five-year engineer that they won't have already learned the hard way.  In other words, it's an incredibly valuable course to a first or second year engineer.  Covers all the basics: earned value, CPI, SPI, and the triangle of doom.

 **Objectives:**
